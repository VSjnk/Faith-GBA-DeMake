<h1>Faith GBA DeMake</h1>
<p>This is a demake of the game Faith Chapter 1 for the gameboy advanced made for my capstone project in school.</p>

<h2>How to build</h2>

<h3>Windows only</h3>h3>
<p>run the "make.bat" file, also make sure you have devkitadv installed inside the root of this folder.</p>

<h2>Why did I make this?</h2>
<p>This is my Career 11 capstone project, where I (a spagetti code programer) have decided to re-create FAITH: Chapter 1 for the GameBoy Advanced!</p>

<h2>Can I use this to make my own version?</h2>

<p>I personally don't care too much about what you do with this spagetti code, but I might be finishing it up in the future if I feel like struggling more. I only ask that you get permission to make your version public from Airdolf (he responds via twitter/X) and please don't remove the starting titles crediting us, almost everything made in this script was all me by hand</p>

<h3>Am I allowed to do this?</h3>
<p>Yes! I have been given permission from airdolf himself to create this game! I asked for permission ahead of time from him before I started making this game because I don't want to go to jail for a law I didn't know existed preventing me from doing this.</p>

<h1>What is the "DevTools" Folder?</h1>
<p>That folder is all of the tools I've used with this program for creating assets for the game. /n I may change out what I use, but everything I'm testing is there.</p>

<h1>Why arn't I using DevKitPro?</h1>
<p>Simple! I'm an idiot!  What I mean by that is I didn't do enough research in compilers, because DevKitAdv is so goddamn old, It's older than me! this compiler also lacks features I had to maually put together myself with Duct-Tape and whats left of my hopes and dreams. I will finish this game in the future (Bring it out of demo) but chapters 2 and 3 (if I every make them) will be compiled with DevKitPro.</p>
