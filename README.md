<h1>Faith GBA DeMake</h1>
<p>This is a demake of the game Faith Chapter 1 for the gameboy advanced made for my capstone project in school.</p>

<h2>How to build</h2>

<p>run the "make.bat" file, also make sure you have devkitadv installed inside the root of this folder.</p>

<h2>Why did I make this?</h2>
<p>This is my Career 11 capstone project, where I (a spagetti code programer) have decided to re-create FAITH: Chapter 1 for the GameBoy Advanced!</p>

<h3>Am I allowed to do this?</h3>
<p>Yes! I have been given permission from airdolf himself to create this game! I asked for permission ahead of time from him before I started making this game because I don't want to go to jail for a law I didn't know existed preventing me from doing this.</p>
